        <h2>Filipino Style Spaghetti</h2>
        <h4>Filipino-style spaghetti, which is popular in the Philippines due to its festive and cozy appeal, is a sweet, savory, and comforting take on the traditional Italian dish. Along with ground beef or pork, the noodles are dipped in a rich, slightly sweet tomato-based sauce that is made unique by banana ketchup and frequently adorned with sausage or hot dog slices. A thick layer of grated processed cheese, usually cheddar, melts into the hot pasta, giving the sweetness a salty, creamy contrast. This dish, which is frequently served at celebrations, family get-togethers, and birthdays, exemplifies the Filipino talent for transforming well-known flavors into something distinctly happy and fulfilling.</h4>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (240 ml) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>grated cheese</li>
            <li>condensed milk</li>
            <li>500 g pasta</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>500 ground pork or beef</li>
            <li>hotdogs diced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Boil the pasta</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with water, bring to a rolling boil, add 1 tbsp salt. Cook the spaghetti until al dente according to package directions (usually 8–10 minutes). Before draining, scoop out and reserve ½–1 cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain and set pasta aside.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Saute the aromatics</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the pasta cooks, heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook 3–4 minutes until softened. Add the minced garlic and sauté 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Brown the meat</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the ground pork/beef to the skillet. Break it up with a spoon and cook 6–8 minutes until no longer pink and nicely browned. If there’s excess fat, carefully drain a little, leaving enough to coat and flavor the sauce.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Cook the hotdogs</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Push the meat to one side, add the sliced hotdogs (or add together with the meat earlier if you prefer). Fry 2–3 minutes until they pick up a little color.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Add sauces and sweetener</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stir in banana ketchup and tomato sauce (or tomato sauce + extra sugar if substituting). Add the 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp Worcestershire/soy sauce if using. Pour in about ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water to loosen the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Simmer and adjust</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then lower heat. Let it simmer 10–15 minutes so flavors meld and the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust: add more brown sugar for sweetness, a pinch of salt, black pepper, or a tiny splash of vinegar if the sauce is overly sweet.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Combine pasta and sauce</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the drained spaghetti into the skillet (or transfer sauce to the pasta pot). Toss thoroughly to coat the noodles. If sauce seems too thick or dry, add a little more reserved pasta water, 1–2 tbsp at a time, until you reach your preferred sauciness.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Add cheese</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stir in about ¾ cup of the grated cheese into the warm spaghetti so it starts to melt and become creamy. Reserve the rest for topping each serving.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Serve</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plate the spaghetti and finish with extra grated cheese on top. Serve hot.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><em>Storage & reheating tips</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated up to 3 days (or frozen). Reheat gently, adding a splash of water to loosen.</li>
                    <li>If reheating pasta already mixed with sauce, add a splash of water or milk and heat slowly to restore creaminess.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
