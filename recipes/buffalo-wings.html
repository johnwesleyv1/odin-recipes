        <h2>Honey styled buffalo wings</h2>
        <h4>Honey Buffalo Wings are a crispy, juicy bite that perfectly combines sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors. After being baked or fried until golden and crunchy, the wings are tossed in a glossy sauce that is made with butter, hot sauce, and a lot of honey. The honey produces a sticky coating that adheres to every wing curve and tempers the heat of the Buffalo sauce with a smooth, caramel-like sweetness. These hot wings, which are frequently served with celery sticks and ranch or blue cheese dressing on the side, offer a delectable blend of flavors and textures that make them a crowd favorite.</h4>

        <h3>Prep time: 10 min • Cook time: 25–30 min • Total: ~40 min</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) chicken wings, split into drumettes and wingettes</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp cornstarch or baking powder (<em>for crispiness)</em></li>
                <li>Oil for frying <em>(or use an air fryer/oven)</em></li>
            </ul>

        <h4>For the buffalo sauce:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>½ cup (120 ml) hot sauce <em>(Frank’s RedHot is traditional)</em></li>
                <li>1 tbsp white vinegar</li>
                <li>½ tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar or honey <em>(optional, for balance)</em></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep the wings</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pat the chicken wings very dry with paper towels — this is key for crispiness. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Toss in cornstarch or baking powder to lightly coat.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Choose your cooking method:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deep-fry (crispiest)</strong>: Heat oil in a deep pot to 175 °C (350 °F). Fry wings in batches for 8–10 minutes until golden and cooked through.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oven-bake</strong>: Preheat oven to 220 °C (425 °F). Arrange wings on a wire rack over a baking tray. Bake 20–25 minutes, flipping halfway.</li>
                        <li><strong>Air fry</strong>: 200 °C (400 °F) for 20–25 minutes, shaking or flipping halfway.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Make the buffalo sauce</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Whisk in hot sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar/honey if using. Heat gently until smooth — do not boil.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Coat the wings</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the wings are cooked and crispy, place them in a large bowl. Pour the warm Buffalo sauce over them and toss until evenly coated.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Serve</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serve immediately with celery sticks and a side of ranch or blue cheese dressing.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>
        <h2>Tips and Variations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extra crispy oven method</strong>: Chill the seasoned, coated wings uncovered in the fridge for at least 1 hour before baking.</li>
                <li>For spicier wings, add cayenne pepper to the sauce.</li>
                <li>For a milder version, reduce the hot sauce to ⅓ cup and increase butter slightly.</li>
            </ul>
